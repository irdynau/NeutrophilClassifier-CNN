# NeutrophilClassifier-CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for automated classification of neutrophils in microscopy images, distinguishing between healthy cells and Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). The model aims to support biomedical research through automate, accurate and efficient cell classification.
